Hi there 👋

Aspiring Frontend Developer | UI/UX Enthusiast

🚀 About Me  
I'm a Computer Science student at Dorset College Dublin, passionate about designing clean and engaging user experiences. I love building interfaces that are not just beautiful but also functional and accessible.

I'm currently diving into **frontend development**, creating interfaces with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Figma. In the future, I want to explore mobile development with **Flutter** and **SwiftUI**, while also learning more about backend to become a well-rounded Full Stack Developer.
